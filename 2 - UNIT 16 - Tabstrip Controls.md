<h1 id="tabs">Tabs</h1>
<p>How it works together<br>
User sees a tab, with some contents on a screen<br>
All together, its a button that controls a subscreen area to show specific subscreens.</p>
<p>To define:</p>
<pre class=" language-abap"><code class="prism  language-abap"><span class="token keyword">CONTROLS</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> my_tabs <span class="token keyword">TYPE</span> <span class="token keyword">TABSTRIP</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then, draw in layout editor.</p>
<p>You can have function codes behind each tab in the strip to add functionality.</p>
<p>Options<br>
Can have one subscreen area and have buttons toggle the screen that shows<br>
ORRRRRR could have many subscreen areas linked to each button… that is when you use special ‘P’ processing for Function Type</p>
